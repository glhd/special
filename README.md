# Special ✨

Sometimes, certain database records are just **special ✨** and you need to
reference them inside your code. Things like a few special partners or vendors
that have special handling in a few places; or special entries that need their
own special artisan commands run from time-to-time.

special ✨ lets you use [backed enums](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.enumerations.backed.php)
to reference Eloquent models. Rather than backing your enum with a string or
integer, think of it as backing your enum with a database record.

If the record is missing, you can let special ✨ automatically create it for
you. This is especially great in testing, where you may have a few special
records that need to exist for a few special tests, but you don't want to 
track which tests need to run special seeders at setup.
